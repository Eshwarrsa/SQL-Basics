# SQL Practice Repository ðŸš§ðŸ”§

Welcome to my SQL practice repository! ðŸŽ‰

I am working on mastering SQL by tackling theory and practical problems in an alternating pattern. This repository contains a mix of explanations on core SQL concepts and hands-on exercises where I create tables, insert data, and write SQL queries. Each task is followed by a review and rating of my progress. As I continue working through various SQL topics, I will update this repository with new challenges and solutions. Stay tuned for ongoing improvements!

## Current Progress: Under Construction ðŸš§

Stay tuned for more updates as I work my way through this SQL journey! ðŸ˜Ž
